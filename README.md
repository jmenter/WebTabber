Experiments in Web Browser Tab Things

To the best of my memory, OmniWeb was the first browser I used that had "visual preview" style tabs running vertically across the left side of the window. I always "kind of" liked that, but at the time there were a combination of hardware constraints and implementation that made them not as good as they could be.

Fast forward to now, and displays are much higher resolution, computers are much faster, and web browsers are much more boring. The goal of this project is to be a playground where I can see if there is an implementation of "visual browser tabs" that feels just right.
